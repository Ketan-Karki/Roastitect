# Roastitect ☕

**Precision architecture meets sensory extraction.** Discover the science behind your perfect cup.

Roastitect is an interactive coffee brewing companion that helps you architect the perfect cup through precision timing, grind calibration, and method selection. Built with modern web technologies and a beautiful liquid glass UI design.

## ✨ Features

### 🎡 Method Wheel

Spin the interactive wheel to randomly select a brewing method. Each method comes with its own profile, story, and optimized parameters.

### ⏱️ Brew Master Timer

A precision timer with method-specific brewing steps:

- **V60**: Bloom, First Pour, Final Pour
- **Espresso**: Pre-infusion, Extraction
- **Aeropress**: Bloom & Stir, Steep
- **French Press**: Bloom, Steep
- **Moka Pot**: Heat, Extraction
- **Easy Pour**: Bloom, Pour

Each method includes real-time step tracking and method-specific architect's tips.

### ⚙️ Grinder Calibration

Get precise grind settings for your grinder:

- **Comandante C40**
- **Timemore C3S Pro** (default)
- **Kingrinder K6**

Each coffee profile includes optimized click/tick settings for all supported grinders.

### 🗺️ Coffee Journey

Explore the complete journey from cultivation to extraction:

1. **Cultivation & Origin** - Learn about the coffee's terroir
2. **Roast Architecture** - Understand the roast level and flavor development
3. **Precision Grinding** - Get exact grind settings for your equipment
4. **Sensory Extraction** - Master the brewing process

### 🎨 Beautiful UI

- Liquid glass morphism design
- Smooth animations with Framer Motion
- 3D coffee scene visualization
- Fully responsive (mobile-first)
- Dark theme with gold accents

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Roastitect embraces an "architectural" approach to coffee brewing:

- **Precision** - Exact measurements and timing
- **Structure** - Understanding the science behind extraction
- **Artistry** - Beautiful presentation and user experience
- **Education** - Learning the journey from bean to cup

## 🚀 Deployment

The app can be deployed to a subdomain (e.g. **roastitect.ketankarki.wiki**) on a Digital Ocean droplet. Setup is one-time; after that, pushes to `main` deploy automatically via GitHub Actions.

- **One-time server setup:** nginx config, web root, DNS, optional SSL — see **[deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md)**.
- **GitHub secrets:** `DEPLOY_HOST`, `DEPLOY_USER`, `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` (details in deploy README).
- **Auto-deploy:** workflow [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) runs on push to `main` or `master`.

### "Permission denied (publickey)" in GitHub Actions

1. **Public key must be on the server.** The key you put in `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` has a matching **public** key (same key pair). On your **laptop**, run `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` (or `id_rsa.pub`). Then on the **server** (`ssh siu`), ensure that line is in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`:  
   `echo "paste-the-public-key-line" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
2. **Use the correct user.** `DEPLOY_USER` must be the user that owns `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the server (e.g. `ketan` if you log in as `ketan@vegeta`).
3. **No passphrase.** The private key in the secret must be for a key generated without a passphrase, or GitHub Actions cannot use it.
4. **Paste the full private key.** In the secret, paste the entire key including the `-----BEGIN ... PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END ... PRIVATE KEY-----` lines, with no extra spaces at the start or end.
